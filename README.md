## Synopsis

You are a resident of a small town located in the middle of the Gaul Forest. You live a peaceful life in harmony with the surrounding nature.  
  
One day, this tranquility was disrupted by bandits. Without asking anyone's permission, they began cutting down trees, hunting animals, and disturbing the forest's ecosystem.  
  
You tried to reason with them, but to no avail... If you do nothing, the forest will be lost forever!

* Confront 90 different types of enemies across 97 levels that will test your reflexes and strategic sense!
